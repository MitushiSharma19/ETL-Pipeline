# ETL-Pipeline
This project includes Python scripts for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, extracting data from MySQL and PostgreSQL, transforming it (cleaning, reformatting), and loading it into Hive tables. The scripts automate data integration, making it ready for distributed analysis in Hive.
